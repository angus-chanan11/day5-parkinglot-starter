# O
I have experience the whole process of TDD, including requirement clarification, writing test cases, and implementing the required features.

# R
I think that TDD can let us better focus on each feature and make sure that every feature is implemented correctly. I also start to see the benefit of baby step commit.

# I
TDD not only improves the accuracy and reliability of the features but also enhances the overall development process by providing a clear structure and reducing errors early on. Baby step commit also help us to checkpoint our progress and reduce the pain to debug when the change is too big and hard to trace the source of issue

# D
In my future work, I will adopt TDD and baby step commits. While I might not always commit in "baby steps", I will ensure all test cases could pass when I make small changes.
